      Cypress is an open-source end-to-end testing framework designed for
      front-end developers. It allows you to write and execute tests to ensure
      that your web application behaves as expected. Cypress is built using
      JavaScript and offers a simple and intuitive API for writing tests.
      <br />
      One of the key features of Cypress is its ability to automate tests that
      simulate user interactions within a web browser. It provides automatic
      waiting, real-time reloading, and DOM manipulation capabilities. Cypress
      also offers a wide range of built-in assertions, making it easy to
      validate the expected behavior of your application.
      <br />
      Cypress comes with powerful debugging tools that help developers quickly
      identify and fix issues. It provides clear error messages, detailed
      reports, and logging functionalities to facilitate the debugging process.
      <br />
      What sets Cypress apart is its unique architecture. Unlike other testing
      frameworks that rely on Selenium or similar tools, Cypress runs directly
      in the browser. This enables faster and more reliable test execution.
      <br />
      In summary, Cypress is a powerful and user-friendly testing framework that
      helps improve testing efficiency and quality for front-end developers.
